An Arduino Sketch that plays any song/melody on a piezo speaker connected to an Arduino. There is also an LED that flashes to the rythm.

Demo here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYm4DXZPXf0

Make sure your LED is connected to pin 13 and the piezo is connected to pin 12.

The default melody is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, although this can be changed easily by changing the notes variable.

I've tested it on a Leonardo but it should work on all other models.
